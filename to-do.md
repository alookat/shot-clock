##Things to do:

1. ~~Finish all tooltips~~
2. ~~Get rid of side column/s~~ (move to bottom)
3. ~~Basic margin & padding adjustments~~
4. ~~Add name to scale on right~~ (rotated text)
5. ~~Finish copy at top of page~~
6. ~~Make fixed layouts (one at 1800, one at 1200, one at 900, the 'use a desktop' one at ~700)~~


###If there's time:
1. Get button functionality working
2. More graphs
3. Re-order #ppg svg by z-index, so the shapes that are covered up (and therefore don't show a tooltip) are at the bottom of the DOM; at the 'front' of the screen, & therefore selectable
4. Fix up opacity on those re-ordered circles
5. Attribute the database websites
6. Better team logos (NYN, SAC)
7. Better copy

interactive data visualisation on the NBA's Shot Clock

The 24-second Shot Clock saved the NBA. Invented by Syracuse Nationals owner Danny Biasone and introduced officially for the 1954-55 season, changes in points per game, pace, field-goal attempts, and attendance were dramatic.

Shot-clock is an interactive data visualisation which maps the changes in points per game (PPG) and attendance in the eight seasons before, after, and including the decisive 1954-55 season.
